    "In this lab, we will learn how to use `Python` to make interval estimates of distribution parameters based on observed data. For an unknown parameter $\\theta$, a point estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ is a single-value estimate of the parameter, which can be obtained by the method of maximum likelihood, among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interval estimate of the parameter $\\theta$, which is usually denoted $(\\hat{\\theta}_{lower},\\hat{\\theta}_{upper})$, represents the interval within which the true value of the parameter lies with $(1-\\alpha)*100$% confidence. The most common value of $\\alpha$ is $0.05$, i.e., the interval is obtained for 95% confidence level. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we saw that a two-sided confidence interval for the population mean can be given by the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\overline{X} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} * \\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\overline{X}$ is the sample mean, $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, $n$ is the sample size, and $z_{\\alpha /2}$ is the multiplier corresponding to the critical values of a $z$-random variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation is only applicable when: (i) the underlying population is normal and the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is known, or (ii) the sample size $n$ is large enough, even if the population standard deviation is unknown and the samples come from any distribution. In this case, the sample standard deviation $s$ is used instead of $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sample size $n$ is not large enough and the population standard deviation is unknown, student's $t$-distribution should be used. The $t$-distribution can be used only if the samples come from a normal distribution. In this case, a two-sided confidence interval for the population mean can be given by the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\overline{X} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} * \\dfrac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical values ($z_{\\alpha/2}$ or $t_{\\alpha/2}$) can be easily found in `Python` using the `.ppf()` method of common distributions. For example, `norm.ppf(0.95)` returns $z_{0.05}$. In general, `norm.ppf(1-b)` returns $z_{b}$. If you are interested in a one-sided confidence interval, $b = \\alpha$. Otherwise, for a two-sided confidence interval, $b = \\alpha/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $t$-distribution, `t.ppf(1-b, df=n-1)` returns $t_{b, n-1}$. If you are interested in a one-sided confidence interval, $b = \\alpha$. Otherwise, for a two-sided confidence interval, $b = \\alpha/2$. Note that you have to specify the degrees of freedom `df` in this case, which is equal to the sample size minus one: $n-1$.\n",

If we do not know (or can't approximate) the distribution of the estimator, it is impossible to construct a confidence interval using the methods we discussed in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the nice thing about bootstrapping is that we do not need to make any assumptions on the distributions, and there are no restrictions. We can generate confidence intervals for **any** estimate, regardless of the distribution of the data, or the bootstrapped estimate. We saw that the distribution of the bootstrapped means appears to follow a normal distribution in this case. However, this is not required to get a bootstrapped confidence interval. Regardless of the distribution of the estimate, we can still use the exact same procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed the Central Limit Theorem, which says that the sum or average of many distributions tends toward normal. That's why our confidence intervals for the mean were based on a normal distribution. What if we want a confidence interval for the **median**?! We have no idea what the distribution of the median is! That's when bootstrapping becomes extremely helpful.\n",
