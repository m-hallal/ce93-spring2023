    "### Hypothesis Testing for Difference in Means\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both samples here are small (10 and 15 samples), we cannot use the central limit theorem to approximate the distribution of the sample means as normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only exception is if the underlying population is normal. In this case, the distribution of the sample means would be a $t$-distribution and the distribution of the difference in means can also be approximated as a $t$-distribution. There are formulas to perform this hypothesis test on the difference in means from small samples, but we haven't covered them in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will therefore use existing functions to perform the above hypothesis test for difference in means using small samples. We will use the following function: [`ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var, alternative)`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html#scipy.stats.ttest_ind)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `a` is the first observed sample\n",
    "* `b` is the second observed sample\n",
    "* `equal_var`: if `True` (default), the test assumes equal population variances for `a` and `b`. If `False`, the test does not assume equal population variances for `a` and `b`. The best practice is to assume the variances to be unequal unless it is quite certain that they are equal. So, it is recommended to specify this as 'False'.\n",
    "* `alternative` takes on the following values:\n",
    "    1. ‘two-sided’: $H_1: \\mu_a \\neq \\mu_b$\n",
    "    2. ‘greater’: $H_1: \\mu_a > \\mu_b$\n",
    "    3. ‘less’: $H_1: \\mu_a < \\mu_b$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the order of the samples, `a` and `b` is important for one-sided tests. If you use `altenrative='greater'`, the test will be performed for $H_1: \\mu_a > \\mu_b$, where $\\mu_a$ is the population mean corresponding to the first input, `a`, and $\\mu_b$ is the population mean corresponding to the second input, `b`.**\n",

    "## Extra: Bootstrapping Difference in Means\n",

    "As previously mentioned, $t$-tests require that the underlying population be normal, which is not always true. In this case we can perform bootstrapping to get confidence intervals and reach a conclusion for the hypothesis testing. Our hypotheses were: \n",

We can then compute the difference of the means of the bootstrapped samples, and this would be one sample for $\\mu_L - \\mu_F$. If we repeat this 5000 times, we will get 5000 bootstrapped samples for the difference in means. Then, we can compute the appropriate confidence interval for $\\mu_L - \\mu_F$ based on $\\alpha$ and the alternative hypothesis. Finally, if the value $\\mu_L - \\mu_F =0 $ is within the bootstrapped difference in means, we fail to reject $H_0$.\n",
    "Otherwise, if the null hypothesized value is not within the confidence interval, we reject $H_0$.\n",
