    "In this lab, we will learn how to use `Python` to perform linear regression. We will work with on-time performance of domestic flights in the U.S. You will be asked to build, fit, and evaluate the model(s) that help us better understand the data, more specifically, draw inferences about the relationships of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "On-time performance (OTP) is a measure of the ability of transport services to be on time. Airlines’ on-time performance is closely monitored. In the U.S., a flight is considered as delayed if it arrives at the destination gate 15 minutes or more after its scheduled arrival time. The major U.S. airlines (United, Delta, American, and Southwest) had OTPs between 85$-$75% in 2022. (Who had the lowest OTP among these airlines? You guessed it; starts with S). \n",
    "\n",
    "Flight delay can be caused by several reasons, such as bad weather, airport congestion, airspace congestion, and lower cruising speed due to high fuel costs. In return, delay can increase operation cost, passenger delay cost and fuel cost. It would be helpful if we could predict our flight time to help set the schedule and reduce delays as much as possible.\n",
