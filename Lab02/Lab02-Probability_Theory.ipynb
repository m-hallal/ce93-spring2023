Let's say $E_3$ was the probability that the amount of cumulative rainfall in a given year is less than 10 inches.

To simply count the number of times this has occurred, we can use the `sum()` function. True is counted as 1 and False is counted as 0. So, the `sum(rain<10)` is the frequency or the total number of years where rain<10.\n",
